Because we have labels that are none existent for certain aspects, we are incapable of training to classify all aspects at once. 

Therefore, we must train a classifier for each individual aspect individually.

This is handled by an argument to the classifier.py file, which specifies which aspect to train for (overall, location, service, or price)
